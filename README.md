# Precision Cropland Mapping Unveiling Agricultural Patterns with Machine-Learning


# Overview

Welcome to the Cropland Mapping Machine Learning Project! This project focuses on the accurate classification of croplands using a powerful combination of optical and radar data. Leveraging a unique dataset sourced from Rapid Eye satellites and UAVSAR over an agricultural region near Winnipeg, Canada, this project aims to optimize precision agriculture, resource allocation, and environmental monitoring.

# Dataset

The dataset comprises 325,834 observations, each with 175 attributes. The 'label' variable represents crop classes, including Corn, Pea, Canola, Soy, Oat, Wheat, and Broadleaf. Predictive features include polarimetric radar and optical data collected on July 5th and 14th, 2012.

# Methodology

Two machine learning algorithms were implemented:
- **Random Forest:** Using 100 decision trees, this model effectively classifies cropland based on the fused optical-radar dataset.
- **Neural Networks:** With three hidden layers, this model offers a deeper understanding of complex patterns in cropland mapping.

# Results

The project achieved remarkable results:
- Random Forest: 99.62% accuracy
- Neural Networks: 99.82% accuracy

These results highlight the effectiveness of the chosen algorithms and the fused dataset in accurate cropland mapping.

# Usage

To run the project, ensure you have the required libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras) installed. The code is organized into sections such as preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for easy navigation.

# Future Work

While the models performed exceptionally well overall, future work could involve exploring additional machine learning techniques, incorporating diverse datasets, and refining models to handle specific challenges, such as class imbalances.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment, and contribute to the advancement of precision cropland mapping!
